                <p>
                  <b>Solar energy</b> is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such 
                  as <a href="#">solar heating</a>, <a href="#">photovoltaics</a>, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power
                  plants and artificial photosynthesis 
                </p> 
                <p> 
                  It is an essential source of <a href="/Renewable">renewable energy</a>, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either 
                  <a href="#">passive solar</a> or <a href="http://www.cres.gr/kape/energeia_politis/energeia_politis_active_solar_uk.htm">active 
                  solar</a> depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques 
                  include the use of <a href="#">photovoltaic systems</a>, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy. 
                  Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable <a href="#">thermal mass</a> 
                  or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that <a href="#">naturally circulate air</a>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity. The United Nations Development 
                  Programme in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837 exajoules (EJ). 
                  This is several times larger than the total <a href="#">world energy consumption</a>, which was 559.8 EJ in 2012. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                  In 2011, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) said that 
                  "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will 
                  increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible, and mostly import-independent resource, 
                  enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating global warming, and keep <a href="/Fuel">fossil fuel</a> 
                  prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment 
                  should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".

                <p>
                  The Earth receives 174 <a href="https://www.aqua-calc.com/what-is/power/petawatt">petawatts</a> (PW) of incoming solar radiation 
                  (<a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Insolation">insolation</a>) at the upper atmosphere. Approximately 30% is 
                  reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's 
                  surface is mostly spread across the visible and <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/~tt/Lectures/Galaxies/Images/Infrared/Regions/irregions.html">near-infrared</a> 
                  ranges with a small part in the <a href="https://www.hepacart.com/blog/far-uv-vs.-near-uv">near-ultraviolet</a>. Most of the 
                  world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air 
                  containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing <a href="#">atmospheric circulation</a> or convection. When the air 
                  reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface,
                  completing the <a href="#">water cycle</a>. The <a href="#">latent heat</a> of water condensation amplifies convection, 
                  producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, <a href="#">cyclones</a> and <a href="#">anti-cyclones</a>. Sunlight absorbed by 
                  the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar 
                  energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the <a href="#">biomass</a> from which fossil fuels are 
                  derived.
                </p> 
                <p>
                  The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 3,850,000<a href="#">exajoules</a> (EJ) per year.
                  In 2002, this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year. Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per
                  year in biomass. The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as 
                  much as will ever be obtained from all of the Earth's non-renewable resources of coal, oil, natural gas, and mined uranium 
                  combined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present
                  near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the
                  land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the <a href="#">equator</a> have a higher amount of 
                  solar radiation. However, the use of <a href="#">photovoltaics</a> that can follow the position of the Sun can significantly 
                  increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar 
                  energy because during the nighttime, there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for <a href="#">solar panels</a>
                  to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. <a href="#">Cloud cover</a> can affect the 
                  potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the Sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides, land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can 
                  only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs are a suitable
                  place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their
                  homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for
                  businesses where solar plants can be established.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture,
                  convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the
                  world, mostly depending on the distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the
                  use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than <a href="/Geothermal" title="Geothermal power">
                  Geothermal power</a> and <a href="/Tidal" title="Tidal power">Tidal power</a>, derive their energy either directly or
                  indirectly from the Sun.
                </p>  
                <p>
                  Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, <a href="#">solar thermal collectors</a>, pumps, and fans 
                  to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties,

                  Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass 
                  materials include stone, cement, and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep 
                  buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, 
                  they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several 
                  factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions. When duly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures 
                  in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.

                  A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft 
                  connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated, causing an 
                  <a href="#">updraft</a> that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass 
                  material in a way that mimics greenhouses.

                  <a href="#">Deciduous</a> trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted

                  provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 
                  1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of

                  Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying, and <a href="#">pasteurization</a>. They can be grouped into three broad 
                  categories: box cookers, panel cookers, and reflector cookers. The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by 
                  <a href="#">Horace de Saussure</a> in 1767. A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can 
                  be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90–150°C (194–302°F). Panel cookers 
                  use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. 
                  Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. 
                  These cookers reach temperatures of 315°C (599°F) and above but require direct light to function properly and must be 
                  repositioned to track the Sun.

                  Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide
                  process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the <a href="#">Solar Total Energy
                  Project</a> (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, US where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air 
                  conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of 
                  electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal 
                  storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through <a href="#">evaporation</a>. The use of 
                  evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include 
                  concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. <a href="#">Clothes lines</a>,

                  electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the "right to dry" clothes. Unglazed transpired 
                  collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature 
                  up to 22°C (40°F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60°C (113–140°F). The short payback period of transpired collectors 
                  (3 to 12 years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems. As of 2003, over 80 systems with a 
                  combined collector area of 35,000 square metres (380,000 sqft) had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m<sup>2</sup>

                  when it was founded, the winner's average speed was 67 kilometres per hour (42&#160;mph) and by 2007 the winner's average speed 
                  had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour (56.46&#160;mph). The <a href="#">North American Solar Challenge</a> and the planned 
                  <a href="#">South African Solar Challenge</a> are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the 
                  engineering and development of solar powered vehicles.

                  In 1975, the first practical solar boat was constructed in England. By 1995, passenger boats
                  incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively. In 1996, <a href="#">Kenichi Horie</a> made the first 
                  solar-powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean, and the <i>Sun21</i> catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of
                  the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 2006–2007. There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.

                  In 1974, the unmanned <a href="#">AstroFlight Sunrise</a> airplane made the first solar flight. On 29 April 1979, the 
                  <i><a href="#"> Solar Riser</a></i> made the first flight in a solar-powered, fully controlled, man-carrying flying machine, 
                  reaching an altitude of 40&#160;ft (12&#160;m). In 1980, the <i><a href="#" >Gossamer Penguin</a></i> made the first piloted
                  flights powered solely by photovoltaics. This was quickly followed by the <i><a href="#">Solar Challenger</a></i>
                  which crossed the English Channel in July 1981. In 1990 <a href="#">Eric Scott Raymond</a> in 21 hops flew from California to 
                  North Carolina using solar power. Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the <i><a href="#">Pathfinder</a></i> 
                  (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the <i><a href="#">Helios</a></i> which set the altitude record for a 
                  non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres (96,864&#160;ft) in 2001. The <i><a href="#">Zephyr</a></i>, developed by
                  <a href="#">BAE Systems</a>, is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft, making a 54-hour flight in 2007, and 
                  month-long flights were envisioned by 2010. As of 2016, <a href="#">Solar Impulse</a>, an <a href="#">electric aircraft</a>, 
                  is currently circumnavigating the globe. It is a single-seat plane powered by <a href="#"> solar cells</a> and capable of 
                  taking off under its own power. The design allows the aircraft to remain airborne for several days.

                  A <a href="#">solar balloon</a> is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air 
                  inside is heated and expands, causing an upward <a href="#">buoyancy</a> force, much like an artificially heated 
                  <a href="#">hot air balloon</a>. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the 
                  toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.

                  <a href="#">Thermal mass</a> systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily 
                  or <a href="#">interseasonal durations</a>. Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high
                  <a href="#">specific heat</a> capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well-designed systems can lower 
                  <a href="#">peak demand</a>, shift time-of-use to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/off-peak">off-peak</a> hours

                  Phase change materials such as <a href="#">paraffin wax</a> and
                  <a href="#"> Glauber's salt</a> are another thermal storage medium. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can 
                  deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately 64&#160;°C or 147&#160;°F). The "Dover House" 
                  (in <a href="#">Dover, Massachusetts</a>) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948. Solar energy can also 
                  be stored at high temperatures using <a href="#">molten salts</a>. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are 
                  low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. 
                  The <a href="#">Solar Two</a> project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44 
                  <a href="#">terajoules</a> (400,000&#160;kWh) in its 68 m³ storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.

                  Off-grid <a href="#"> PV systems</a> have traditionally used <a href="#">rechargeable batteries</a> to store excess electricity. 
                  With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission <a href="#"> grid </a>, while standard grid 
                  electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. <a href="#">Net metering</a> programs give household
                  systems credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter
                  whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero,
                  the utility then rolls over the kilowatt-hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of
                  two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the
                  increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both
                  directions, making a second meter unnecessary.

                  elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing
                  the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator.

                  Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use
                  until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with
                  photovoltaics, <a href="#">solar water heating</a> attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s, but 
                  interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed 
                  steadily throughout the 1990s, and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.
                  Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed
                  solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154&#160; GW as of 2007.

                  In 2011, a report by the <a href="#"> International Energy Agency</a> found that solar energy
                  technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water, and concentrated solar power could provide a third
                  of the world's energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting <a href="#"> climate change</a> and transitioning to
                  renewable energy. The energy from the Sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global
                  economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters. "The strength of solar
                  is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale".
