                  Solar Energy is produced by the Sunlight is a non-vanishing renewable source of energy which is free from ecofriendly. 
                  Every hour enough sunlight energy reaches the earth to meet the worldâs energy demand for a whole year. In todayâs
                  generation we needed Electricity every hour. This Solar Energy is generated by as per applications like industrial, commercial,
                  and residential. It cans easily energy drawn from direct sunlight. So it is very efficiency and free environment pollution for
                  surrounding.

                <p> 
                  Nowadays, due to the decreasing amount of <a href="/Renewable">renewable energy</a> resources, the last ten years become more important for per watt cost
                  of solar energy device. It is definitely set to become economical in the coming years and growing as better technology in terms of
                  both cost and applications. Everyday earth receives sunlight above (1366W approx.) This is an unlimited source of energy which is
                  available at no cost. The major benefit of solar energy over other conventional power generators is that the sunlight can be directly
                  converted into solar energy with the use of smallest photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. There have been a large amount of research
                  activities to combine the Sunâs energy process by developing solar cells/panels/module with high converting form. The most
                  advantages of solar energy is that it is free reachable to common people and available in large quantities of supply compared to that
                  of the price of various <a href="/Fuel">fossil fuels</a> and <a href="/Oil">oils</a> in the past ten years. Moreover, solar energy requires considerably lower manpower

                  Amount of energy in the form of heat and radiations called solar energy. It is radiant light and heat from sun that is
                  natural source of energy using a range of ever changing and developing of technology such as solar thermal energy, solar
                  architecture, solar heating, molten salt power plant and artificial photosynthesis. The large magnitude of solar power available
                  makes highly appealing source of electricity.
                  The Earth receives 174 <a href="https://www.aqua-calc.com/what-is/power/petawatt">petawatts</a> (PW) of incoming solar radiation 
                  (<a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Insolation">insolation</a>) at the upper atmosphere. Approximately 30% is 
                  reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. 
                  <img src="/static/image/Potential.png"> 
                </p> 
                <p>
                  The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 3,850,000<a href="#">exajoules</a> (EJ) per year.
                  In 2002, this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year. Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per
                  year. The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as 
                  much as will ever be obtained from all of the Earth's non-renewable resources of coal, oil, natural gas, and mined uranium 
                  combined. In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and <a href="#">World Energy 
                  Council</a> published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account 
                  factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global
                  potential of 1,600 to 49,800 exajoules (4.4Ã10<sup>14</sup> to 1.4Ã10<sup>16</sup> kWh) per year.

                  Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture,
                  convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the
                  world, mostly depending on the distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the
                  use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than <a href="/Geothermal" title="Geothermal power">
                  Geothermal power</a> and <a href="/Tidal" title="Tidal power">Tidal power</a>, derive their energy either directly or
                  indirectly from the Sun.
                </p>   
                <p>
                  Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, <a href="#">solar thermal collectors</a>, pumps, and fans 
                  to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties,
                  designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies 
                  increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for 
                  alternate resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies.

                <p>
                  Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying, and <a href="#">pasteurization</a>. They can be grouped into three broad 
                  categories: <a href="#">box cookers</a>, <a href="#">panel cookers</a>, and <a href="#">reflector cookers</a>. The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by 
                  <a href="#">Horace de Saussure</a> in 1767. A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can 
                  be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90â150Â°C (194â302Â°F). Panel cookers 
                  use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. 
                  Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, <a href="#">Fresnel mirrors</a>) to focus light on a cooking container. 
                  These cookers reach temperatures of 315Â°C (599Â°F) and above but require direct light to function properly and must be 
                  repositioned to track the Sun.

                  Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide
                  process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the <a href="#">Solar Total Energy
                  Project</a> (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, US where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air

                  Molten salt can be employed as a <a href="#">thermal energy storage</a> method to retain thermal energy collected by
                  a solar tower or <a href="#">solar trough</a> of a concentrated solar power plant so that it can be used to
                  generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995â1999. The system is 
                  predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it
                  into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The
                  most extended mixture contains <a href="#">sodium nitrate</a>, <a href="#">potassium nitrate</a> and <a href="#">calcium nitrate</a>. 
                  It is non-flammable and non-toxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid.
                  Hence, experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.

                  insulated "cold" storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the
                  focused irradiance heats it to 566&#160;Â°C (1,051&#160;Â°F). It is then sent to a hot storage tank. This

                    which is called the <em><a href="#">Photovoltaic effect</a></em>. This phenomenon was first <a href="#">exploited</a> in 
                    1954 by scientists at Bell Laboratories who created a working solar cell made from silicon that generated an electric current 
                    when exposed to sunlight. Solar cells were soon being used to power space satellites and smaller items such as calculator and watches.

                  The most efficient type of solar cell to date is a <a href="#">multi-junction concentrator solar cell</a> with an efficiency of 
                  46.0% produced by <a href="#">Fraunhofer ISE</a> in December 2014. The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration 
                  include a material by <a href="#">Sharp Corporation</a> at 35.8% using a proprietary <a href="#">triple-junction</a> 
                  manufacturing technology in 2009, and <a href="#">Boeing Spectrolab</a> (40.7% also using a triple-layer design). 
                  The US-based specialty <a href="#">gallium arsenide</a> (GaAs) PV manufacturer <a href="#">Alta Devices</a> produces 
                  commercial cells with 26% efficiency claiming to have "the world's most efficient solar" single-junction cell 
                  dedicated to flexible and lightweight applications. For Silicon solar cell, the US company <a href="#">SunPower</a> 
                  remains the leader with a certified module efficiency of 22.8%, well above the market average of 15â18%. 
                  However, competitor companies are catching up like the South Korean conglomerate <a href="#" >LG</a> 
                  (21.7% efficiency) or the Norwegian <a href="#">REC Group</a> (21.7% efficiency). 
                  <a href="#">Perovskite cells</a> are also rapidly (as of 2019) progressing, with top efficiencies increasing 
                  from 13% to 23.7% for non stabilized cells and up to 28% for perovskite/Si tandem monolithic cells between 2012 and 2018.

                  There is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily 
                  for competitive advantage. In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a 
                  semiconductor material with an appropriate <a href="#">band gap</a> that matches the solar spectrum. 
                  This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is 
                  also useful for increasing the efficiency.

                <p>
                  One of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating. The efficiency of a solar cell 
                  declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase 
                  in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are 
                  one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed 
                  from <a href="#">silica</a>, and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach 
                  the <a href="#">solar cells</a>, but reflects infrared rays (which carry heat).

                      A photovoltaic system, also PV system or solar power system, is a power system designed to supply 
                      usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, 
                      including solar panels to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to convert 
                      the output from direct(DC) to alternating current(AC), as well as mounting, cabling, and other electrical 
                      metarials to set up a working system.  
                      As PV systems convert light directly into electricity, they are not to be confused with other solar technologies, 
                      such as concentrated solar power or solar thermal, used for heating and cooling.

                        All solar power systems work on the same basic principles. Solar panels first convert solar 
                        energy or sunlight into DC power using what is known as the photovoltaic (PV) effect. 
                        The DC power can then be stored in a battery or converted by a solar inverter into AC power 
                        which can be used to run home appliances. Depending on the type of system, excess solar energy 
                        can also be fed into the electricity grid to provide credits and further reduce electricity costs.

                        <h6><b><em>1. On-Grid System</h6></b></em> 
                        On-grid or grid-tie solar systems are by far the most common and widely used by homes and businesses. 
                        These systems do not need batteries and use common solar inverters and are connected to the public electricity grid. 
                        Any excess solar power that you generate is exported to the electricity grid and you usually get paid 
                        a feed-in-tariff (FiT) or credits for the energy you export. Unlike hybrid systems, on-grid solar systems 
                        are not able to function or generate electricity during a blackout due to safety reasons. 
                        Since blackouts usually occur when the electricity grid is damaged; If the solar inverter was 
                        still feeding electricity into a damaged grid it would risk the safety of the people repairing 
                        the fault/s in the network. Most hybrid solar systems with battery storage are able to automatically 
                        isolate from the grid (known as islanding) and continue to supply some power during a blackout.
                        Batteries are able to be added to on-grid systems at a later stage if required. The Tesla Powerwall 2 is a 
                        popular AC battery system which can be added to an existing solar system.

In this description I am assuming that the meter is only measuring the electricity being exported to the grid, as is the case in most of Australia. In some states, meters measure all solar electricity produced by your system, and therefore your electricity will run through your meter <em>before</em> reaching the switchboard and not after it. In some areas (currently in California), the meter measures both production and export, and the consumer is charged (or credited) for net electricity used over a month or year period. I will explain more about metering in a later blog.</p>

                        <h6><b><em>2. Off-Grid System</h6></b></em> 
                        An off-grid system is not connected to the electricity grid and therefore requires battery storage. Off-grid solar systems must be designed appropriately so that they will generate enough power throughout the year and have enough battery capacity to meet the homeâs requirements, even in the depths of winter when there is generally much less sunlight. 
                        The high cost of batteries and off-grid inverters means off-grid systems are much more expensive than on-grid systems and so are usually only needed in more remote areas that are far from the electricity grid. However battery costs are reducing rapidly, so there is now a growing market for off-grid solar battery systems even in cities and towns.
                        There are different types of off-grid systems which we will go into more detail later, but for now I will keep it simple. This description is for an AC coupled system, in a DC coupled system power is first sent to the battery bank, then sent to your appliances.

                        <h6><b><em>3. Hybrid System</h6></b></em>
                        Modern hybrid systems combine solar and battery storage in one and are now available in many different forms and configurations. Due to the decreasing cost of battery storage, systems that are already connected to the electricity grid can start taking advantage of battery storage as well. This means being able to store solar energy that is generated during the day and using it at night. When the stored energy is depleted, the grid is there as a back up, allowing consumers to have the best of both worlds. Hybrid systems are also able to charge the batteries using cheap off-peak electricity (usually after midnight to 6am).

                    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
                      <b><em>Solar Panels:-</em></b> Most modern solar panels are made up of many silicon based photovoltaic or PV cells which generate <a href="#">direct current<a> (DC) electricity from solar energy. The individual PV cells are linked together within the solar panel and connected to <a href="#">adjacent panels</a> using DC cables. Note: It is light energy or irradiance, not heat, which produces electricity in photovoltaic cells. Solar panels also known as solar modules are installed together in âstringsâ to create a what is known as a <a href="#">solar array</a>. The amount of solar energy generated depends on a number of factors including the orientation and <a href="#">tilt angle</a> of the solar panels, efficiency of the solar panel, plus any losses due to shading, dirt and even ambient temperature. There are many different solar panel manufacturers on the market so it worth knowing which are the best solar panels and why. Solar panels can generate energy during cloudy and overcast weather but the amount of energy depends on the 'thickness' and height of the clouds, which determines how much dispersed light can pass through. The amount of light energy is known as solar irradiation and usually averaged over the whole day using the term <a href="#">Peak Sun Hours</a> (PSH). The amount of PSH or average sunlight hours can vary greatly throughout the year depending on the location.
                    </p>
                    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> 
                      <b><em>Solar Inverter:-</b></em> Solar panels generate DC electricity which needs to be converted to alternating current (AC) electricity for use in our homes and businesses which is primary the role of the <a href="#">solar inverter</a>. In a âstringâ inverter system, solar panels are linked together in series and the DC electricity is brought to a single inverter which converts the DC power to AC power. In a micro inverter system, each panel has itâs own micro inverter attached to the rear side of the panel. The panel still produces DC, but is converted to AC on the roof and is fed straight to the electrical switchboard. There are also more advanced string inverter systems which use small power optimisers attached to back of each solar panel. Power optimisers are able to monitor and control each panel individually and ensure every panel is operating at maximum efficiency under all conditions.
                    <p><img src="/static/image/Inverter.jfif"></p> 
                    </p>
                    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
                      <b><em>Batteries:-</b></em> Batteries used for solar energy storage are available in two main types, <a href="#">lead-acid</a> (AGM and Gel) and <a href="#">lithium-Ion</a>. There are several other types available such as <a href="#">redox flow batteries</a> and sodium-ion but we will focus on the most common two. Most modern energy storage systems use rechargeable <a href="#">lithium-ion batteries</a> and are available in many shapes and sizes which can be configured in several ways. Battery capacity is measured is either Amp hours (Ah) for lead-acid, or kilowatt hours (kWh) for lithium-ion. However, not all of the capacity is available for use, lithium-ion based batteries can typically supply up to 90% of their available capacity per day, while lead-acid batteries should only supply 30 to 40% of their total capacity per day to increase battery life. Lead-acid batteries can be discharged fully, but this should only be done in emergency backup situations. Off-grid solar systems require specialised off-grid inverters and battery systems large enough to store energy for 2 or more days. Hybrid grid-connected systems use lower cost hybrid (battery) inverters, and only require a battery large enough to supply energy for 5 to 10 hours depending on the application.
                    </p>
                    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
                      <b><em>Electricity Switchboard:-</em></b> In a common grid-tie solar system, AC electricity from the solar inverter is sent to the switchboard where it is drawn into the various circuits and appliances in your home. This is known as Net metering, where any excess electricity generated by the solar system is sent the electricity grid through an energy meter or stored a battery storage system if you have a hybrid system. Some countries however, use â<a href="#">Gross metering</a>â where all solar energy is exported to the electricity grid. Hybrid systems can both export excess electricity and store excess energy in a battery. Some Hybrid inverters maybe also be connected to a dedicated backup switchboard which enables some âessential circuitsâ or critical loads to be powered during a grid outage or blackout.

                <p>
                  Solar photovoltaics is growing rapidly and worldwide installed capacity reached about 515 
                  gigawatts (GW) by 2018. The total power output of the world's PV capacity in a calendar year is now beyond 500 TWh of electricity. 
                  This represents 2% of worldwide electricity demand. More than 100 <a href="#">countries</a> use solar PV. 
                  China is followed by the United States and Japan, while installations in Germany, once the world's largest producer, 
                  have been slowing down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2017 a study in Science estimated that by 2030 global PV installed capacities will be between 3,000 and 10,000 GW.
                  The EPIA/<a href="#">Greenpeace</a> Solar Generation Paradigm Shift Scenario (formerly called Advanced Scenario) 
                  from 2010 shows that by the year 2030, 1,845&#160;GW of PV systems could be generating approximately 2,646&#160;TWh/year 
                  of electricity around the world. Combined with energy use efficiency improvements, this would represent the electricity 
                  needs of more than 9% of the world's population. By 2050, over 20% of all electricity could be provided by photovoltaics.

                  A photovoltaic system, or solar PV system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of
                  photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly
                  convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC and other electrical 
                  accessories. PV systems range from small, <a href="#">roof-top mounted</a> or <a href="#">building-integrated</a>
                  systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are 
                  <a href="#">grid-connected</a>, while <a href="#">stand-alone</a> systems only account for a small portion of the market.

                    <p>Integrated Solar is the inclusion of solar power technology as a part of orginal construction rather than as a separate 
                    module that is added later. Integrated solar is most commonly seen in buildings, where it is sometimes referred to as 
                    building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV). Examples of BIPV include windows and roofs with integrated solar, as well as 
                    glass awning with built in photovoltaic cells. Glass awning installations can provide as much as 18% of building's electricity.
                    <a href="#">Building-integrated photovoltaics</a> (BIPV) are increasingly incorporated into the roof or walls of new domestic 
                    and industrial buildings as a principal source of electrical power.</p>
                    <p>Roof tiles with integrated PV cells are sometimes used as well. Provided there is an open gap in which air can circulate,
                    rooftop mounted solar panels can provide a passive cooling effect on buildings during the day and also keep
                    accumulated heat in at night. Typically, residential <a href="#">rooftop systems</a> have small capacities of
                    around 5â10 kW, while commercial rooftop systems often amount to several hundreds of kilowatts.</p>

                  <p>Concentrated solar power (CSP, also known as concentrated solar thermal) systems generate solar power 
                  by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a receiver.
                  Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat (<a href="#">solar thermal energy</a>), 
                  which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator or powers a 
                  <a href="#">thermochemical reaction</a>. CSP had a global total installed capacity of 5,500 MW in 2018, up from 354 MW in 2005. 
                  Spain accounted for almost half of the world's capacity, at 2,300 MW. The United States follows with 1,740 MW. 
                  In 2017, CSP represented less than 2% of worldwide installed capacity of solar electricity plants.
                  However, in recent years the falling prices of CSP plants are making this technology competitive with 
                  other base-load power plants using fossil and nuclear fuel.</p>
  
                  <p>As a thermal energy generating power station, CSP has more in common with thermal power stations such as coal or gas or 
                  geothermal. A CSP plant stores energy either in the form of sensible heat, or as latent heat (for example, using molten salt), 
                  which enables these plants to continue to generate electricity whenever it is needed, day or night. This makes CSP a 
                  <a href="#">dispatchable</a> form of solar. <a href="#">Dispatchable renewable energy</a> is particularly valuable 
                  in places where there is already a high penetration of photovoltaics (PV), such as California because an evening peak is 
                  created as <a href="#">PV ramps</a> down at sunset (a phenomenon referred to as <a href="#">duck curve</a>).</p>

                <h6 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><b><em>Efficiency</h6></b></em> 
                  The efficiency of a concentrating solar power system will depend on the technology used to convert the 
                  solar power to electrical energy. Real-world systems claim a maximum conversion efficiency of 23-35% 
                  for <a href="#">power tower</a> type systems, operating at temperatures from 250-565 Â°C, with the higher efficiency 
                  number assuming a <a href="#">combined cycle turbine</a>. <a href="#">Dish Stirling systems</a>, operating at temperatures of 550-750 Â°C, 
                  claim an efficiency of about 30%. Due to variation in sun incidence during the day, the average conversion 
                  efficiency achieved is not equal to these maximum efficiencies, and the net annual solar-to-electricity 
                  efficiencies are 7-20% for </a href="#">pilot power tower systems</a>, and 12-25% for demonstration-scale <a href="#">Stirling dish systems</a>.
                </p>
                <p>  
                <h6 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><b><em>The working proces of CSP</h6></b></em>
                  <p>All concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies use a mirror configuration to concentrate the sunâs light 
                  energy onto a receiver and convert it into heat. The heat can then be used to create steam to drive a turbine 
                  to produce electrical power or used as <a href="#">industrial process heat</a>.</p>
                  <p>Concentrating solar power plants can integrate thermal energy storage systems to use to generate electricity 
                  during cloudy periods or for hours after sunset or before sunrise. CSP systems can be also combined with 
                  <a href="#">combined cycle power plants</a> resulting in hybrid power plants which provide high-value, dispatchable power. 
                  They can also be integrated into existing thermal-fired power plants that use a power block like CSP; such as coal, 
                  natural gas, biofuel or geothermal plants during periods of low solar radiation.</p>
                  <p>There are four types of CSP technologies, with the earliest in use being trough, and the fastest 
                  growing as of 2017 being tower. For each of these, there are various design variations or different 
                  configurations, depending on whether thermal energy storage is included, and what methods are used to store solar thermally.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> 
                  <b><em>Parabolic Trough Systems:</b></em> In a <a href="#">parabolic trough CSP system</a>, the sunâs energy is concentrated by parabolically curved, trough-shaped reflectors onto a receiver pipe â the heat absorber tube â running along about a meter above the curved surface of the mirrors. The temperature of the heat transfer fluid flowing through the pipe, usually thermal oil, is increased from 293ÂºC to 393ÂºC, and the heat energy is then used in the <a href="#">thermal power block</a> to generate electricity in a conventional steam generator. A trough solar collector field constructs multiple parabolic trough-shaped mirrors in parallel rows aligned to enable these single-axis trough-shaped mirrors to track the sun from east to west during the day to ensure that the sun is continuously focused on the receiver pipes. As of 2018, 90% of the CSP in commercial operation is trough.
                </p> 
                <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> 
                  <b><em>Power Tower Systems: </b></em> <a href="#">Power tower</a> or central receiver systems utilize sun-tracking mirrors called <a href="#">heliostats</a> to focus sunlight onto a receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer fluid heated in the receiver up to around 600ÂºC is used to generate steam, which, in turn, is used in a conventional turbine-generator to produce electricity. <i><a href="#">Khi Solar</a></i> One in South Africa and <i><a href="#">Ivanpah</a></i> in California operate commercially by directly heating water to steam. But <a href="#"><i>Gemasolar</i></a> (2011), <a href="#"><i>Crescent Dunes</a></i> (2013), and <a href="#"><i>Noor III</a></i> (2018) use molten salts because of their <a href="#">superior heat</a> transfer and energy storage capabilities. A great deal of research is investigating various other heat transfer or energy storage materials because of potential to attain higher temperature with resulting efficiency gains leading to lower costs.

                <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> 
                <b><em>Linear Fresnel Systems:</b></em> Similar to the long arrays of a parabolic trough CSP system, a Linear concentrating collector field consists of a large number of collectors in parallel rows. These are typically aligned in a north-south orientation to maximize annual and summer energy collection. The mirrors are laid flat on the ground and reflect the sunlight to the pipe above. Like trough and tower, <a href="#"><i>Fresnel</i></a> can also incorporate storage in a power block, or generate steam for direct use.

                <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> 
                <b><em>Parabolic Dish Systems:</b></em> A <a href="#"><i>Parabolic dish system</a></i> consists of a parabolic-shaped point focus concentrator in the form of a dish that reflects solar radiation onto a receiver mounted at the focal point. These concentrators are mounted on a structure with a two-axis tracking system to follow the sun. The collected heat is typically utilized directly by a heat engine mounted on the receiver moving with the dish structure. Dish can attain extremely high temperatures, and holds promise for use in solar reactors for making solar fuels which require very high temperatures.

                  <p>CSP has a number of environmental effects, particularly on water use, land use and the use of hazardous materials.
                  Water is generally used for cooling and to clean mirrors. Cleaning agents (hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, 
                  hydrogen fluoride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, acetone, and others) are also used for semiconductor surface cleaning. 
                  Some projects are looking into various approaches to reduce the water and cleaning agents use, including the 
                  use of barriers, non-stick coatings on mirrors, water misting systems, and others. Dead warbler burned in mid-air by solar thermal power plant.</p> 
                  <p>Insects can be attracted to the bright light caused by concentrated solar technology, 
                  and as a result birds that hunt them can be killed by being burned if they fly near the point 
                  where light is being focused. This can also affect raptors who hunt the birds. 
                  According to rigorous reporting, in over six months, 133 singed birds were counted. 
                  By focusing no more than four mirrors on any one place in the air during standby, 
                  at Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project, in three months, the death rate dropped to zero. 
                  Other than in the US, no bird deaths have been reported at CSP plants internationally.</p>

                  The <a href="#">Solar Two</a> project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44

                  For behind-the-meter rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes two-way. When there is more local
                  generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid, allowing for <a href="#">
                  net metering</a>. However, electricity networks traditionally are not designed to deal with
                  two-way energy transfer, which may introduce technical issues. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity
                  flows from these PV households back to the network. There are solutions to manage the over-voltage issue, such as
                  regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level,
                  re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to
                  these solutions.

                  There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have
                  different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different
                  usage patterns. <a href="#">Electricity tariff</a> may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge
                  (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a
                  promising option for reducing energy charges when electricity prices are reasonably high and continuously increasing,
                  such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if
                  peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example in residential communities. Overall,
                  energy investment is largely an economic decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematic
                  evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.
