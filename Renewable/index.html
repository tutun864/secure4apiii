            An <a href="#"> energy resource </a> is something that can produce heat, power life, move 
            objects, or produce electricity. Energy resources are the opportunities an area offers to 
            generate electricity based on its natural conditions and circumstances. Some of these energy 
            resources are: <a href="/Coal"> coal </a>,  <a href="/Oil"> oil </a>, wood, or gas. But others, 
            like renewable resources such as <a href="/Wind"> wind </a>, <a href="/Solar"> solar </a>,
            <a href="/Hydro"> hydroelectric </a>,  and <a href="/Wave"> wave power </a>, theyâ€™re based on 
            the natural weather patterns and features of an area. 
          </p> 
          <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Renewable_Energy_Resources">Renewable Energy Resources</span></h2> 
          <hr class="featurette-divider">
          <p>
            The resources which are renewed by nature again and again and their supply is not affected by 
            the rate of their consumption are called renewable resources. The resources are constantly 
            being <a href="#"> replenished </a>, such as <a href="/Solar"> solar </a>, <a href="/Wind"> wind </a>, 
            <a href="#"> biomass </a>, <a href="#"> ocean </a> (thermal, tidal, wave) , <a href="/Geothermal"> geothermal </a> etc. 
            This means that we can use them as much as we want, and we do not have to worry about them running 
            out. Additionally, renewable energy resources are usually much more environmentally friendly than the 
            <a href="/NonRenewable"> non-renewable </a> energy resources. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: 
            electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural <a href="#"> (off-grid) </a> energy 
            services. Renewable energy resources are the possible solution to the depletion of the non-renewable 
            resources. These are the clean energy resources and are available in unlimited supply. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, less than ten percent of all the energy we use comes from renewable sources. 
            We are not using the renewable resources everywhere and all the time because many of the 
            resources are currently expensive to harness, are inefficient, or have other disadvantages.

          <p>
            The sun radiates (sends out) an enormous amount of energy-called <a href="/Solar"> solar energy </a>. 
            It radiates more energy in one second than the world has used since time began. 
            The energy comes from within the sun itself. Solar energy is derived by capturing radiant 
            energy from sunlight and converting it into heat, electricity, or hot water. <a href="#"> Photovoltaic(PV) </a>  
            systems can convert direct sunlight into electricity through the use of </a href="#"> solar cells </a>. Solar energy 
            is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as 
            either </a href="#"> passive solar </a> or <a href="#"> active solar </a> depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy 
            or convert it into solar power. One of the benefits  of solar energy is that sunlight is functionally endless.
            With the technology to harvest it, there is a limitless supply of solar energy, meaning it could render 
            fossil fuels obsolete. Although solar energy will save money in the long run, it tends to be a significant  </a href="#"> upfront 
            cost </a> and is an <a href="#"> unrealistic expenses </a> for most households.

          <div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: <i><a href="/Wind">Wind Energy</a></i></div> 
          <p>
            <a href="#"> Wind </a> is simply air in motion. It is caused by <a href="#">uneven heating of the earthâ€™s surface</a> by radiant 
            energy from the sun. Wind power or wind energy is the use of wind to provide the mechanical power through wind turbines 
            to turn electric generators and traditionally to do other work, like <a href="#"> milling </a> or <a href="#">pumping</a>. 
            <a href="/Wind"> Wind power </a> is a sustainable and renewable energy, and has a much smaller impact on the environment 
            compared to burning fossil fuels. Wind energy is a clean energy source, which means that it does not pollute our environment 
            Although wind turbines produce very little pollution, some cities oppose them since they dominate 
            skylines and generate noise. Wind turbines also threaten local wildlife like birds, which are sometimes 
            killed by </a href="#"> striking </a> the arms of the turbine while flying.
          </p>
          <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydro_power">Hydro power</span></h5> 
          <div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: <i><a href="/Hydro">hydroelectric Power</a></i></div> 
          <p>
            <a href="/Hydro"> Hydropower</a> (hydro means water) is energy that comes from the force of moving water. 
            The fall and flow of water is part of a continuous cycle. Gravity causes the water in rivers and streams to move from 
            the places of high ground to the places of low ground. The force of moving water can be 
            very powerful. Hydroelectric power is very versatile and can be generated using 
            both large scale projects, like the <a href="#"> Hoover Dam </a>, and small scale projects like <a href="#"> underwater 
            turbines</a> and <a href="#"> low dams on small rivers and streams</a> . Hydroelectric power does not generate 
            pollution, and therefore is a much more environmentally-friendly energy option for our 
            environment. Although hydroelectric power does not pollute the air, it </a href="#"> disrupts</a> waterways 
            and negatively affects the animals that live in them, changing water levels, currents, 
            and migration paths for many fish and other freshwater ecosystems.
          </p> 
          <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Geothermal">Geothermal</span></h5> 
          <div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: <i><a href="/Geothermal">Geothermal </a></i></div> 
          <p>
            The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat).<a href="/Geothermal"> Geothermal energy </a> is 
            heat from within the earth. Geothermal energy is generated in the earthâ€™s core, almost 4000 miles 
            <a href="#">beneath</a> the earthâ€™s surface. People around the world use geothermal energy to heat their homes and 
            to produce electricity. Geothermal energy is not as common as other types of renewable energy 
            resources, but it has a significant potential for energy supply. Geothermal energy is naturally <a href="#">replenished</a> and 
            therefore does  not run a risk of depleting (on a human timescale). Cost plays a major factor when it comes to disadvantages 
            of geothermal energy. Not only is it costly to build the infrastructure, but another major concern is its 
            <a href="#">vulnerability</a> to earthquakes in certain regions of the world.
          </p>
          <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Ocean">Ocean</span></h5> 
          <div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: <i><a href="#">Ocean </a></i></div>
          <p>
            <a href="#">Ocean energy</a> refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. 
            The movement of water in the worldâ€™s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy. Some of this energy 
            can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. This type 
             of renewable energy is also <a href="#">abundant</a>; the most populated cities tend to be near the oceans and <a href="#">harbors</a>, 
             making it easier to <a href="#">harness</a> this energy for the local population. Although it is a very clean source of 
             energy, large machinery needs to be built nearby to help capture this form of energy, which can cause 
             <a href="#">disruptions</a> to the ocean floor and the sea life that habitats it. Another factor to consider is weather, 
             when rough weather occurs it changes the consistency of the waves, thus producing lower energy output when 
             compared to normal waves without stormy weather.

          <div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: <i><a href="#">Chemical element(Hydrogen) </a></i></div>
          <p>
            Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. Hydrogen has the <a href="#">highest energy 
            content of any common fuel by weight<a>, but <a href="#">the lowest energy content by volume</a>. It is the lightest element 
            and a gas at normal temperature and pressure. Hydrogen can be used as a <a href="#">clean burning fuel</a>, which leads to less pollution 
            and a cleaner environment. It can also be used for fuel cells which are similar to batteries and can 
            be used for powering an electric motor. Since hydrogen needs energy to be produced, it is inefficient 
            when it comes to preventing pollution.
          </p>
          <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Biomass">Biomass</span></h5> 
          <div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: <i><a href="#">Biomass Energy </a></i></div>
          <p>
            <a href="#">Biomass</a> is any organic matter (anything that was once alive) that can be used as an energy source. 
            People have used biomass longer than any other energy source. Biomass gets its energy from the sun. 
            The use of biomass in energy production creates carbon dioxide that is put into the air, but the regeneration 
            of plants consumes the same amount of carbon dioxide, which is said to create a balanced atmosphere. 
            Although new plants need carbon dioxide to grow, plants take time to grow. We also do not yet have 
            widespread technology that can use biomass in lieu of <a href="fuel">fossil fuels</a>.
